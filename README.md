# Java-program-that-computes-Satisfiability

 This program takes a Boolean espression as input and determines whether it is satisfiable.  
 
There are two versions: SAT has several help functions that output information showing the stages in the execution of the program; SAT-B is the basic program that has all the auxiliary functions removed.  Both are given here as ItelliJ IDEA workspaces.  The file expression.txt is a sample input file. The file Boolean_expressions.txt gives the formal definition of Boolean expression as used here, including the syntax expected for anything that  is put in expression.txt file.  The file expression.txt should be put in the same directory as the InteliJ IDEA worksapce.
