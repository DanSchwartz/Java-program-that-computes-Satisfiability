# Java-program-that-computes-Satisfiability

 This program takes a Boolean espression as input and determines whether it is satisfiable.  There are two versions: SAT has several help functions that output information showing the stages in  the execution of the program; SAT-B is the basic program that has all the auxiliary functions removed.  Both are given here as ItelliJ IDEA workspaces.  The file expression.txt is a sample input file.
