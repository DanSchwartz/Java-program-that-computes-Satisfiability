The Boolean expressions are defined by:

1. The expression variables e1, e2, ... are Boolean expressions,

2. If P and Q are Boolean expressions, then so are ~P, (P V Q), and (P & Q),

3. Nothing else.

It is required that a space occur before and after each occurrence of V and &, but no other spaces are allowed.
